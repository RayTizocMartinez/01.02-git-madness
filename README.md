## Instructions

Add your restaurant reviews below - all in the same file! Use a format like:

### Subway

A really good restaurant because it lets you mix and match your perfect sandwich.

### Taco bell

DON'T GO HERE!!! it will give you the shits, and it will BURN!! not worth 2 dollar burritos!

### Dickies BBQ

Great bbq, my favorite by far, but can sometimes be a bit more expensive than some of the other places lol.

### Green Cuisine

Never get good service at the Alon location. Location at The Pearl is great though. WARNING: NO MEAT

###  Wataburger

Sweet burgers and shit, love this place #squadgoals.

Another review if two people review the same restaurant.

La Fogata
Great food, awesome quac, but the ac is too damn high. #fogataLotta

### Lick

So many good licks to be had here.
I've done a lot of licking - trust me these are good licks.
Sometimes very crowded so you sometimes have to take a licking and NOT keep on ticking!
